clone the git repo (here v0.4.5), https://github.com/MobsLab/plugin-GUI.git
in Resources/Scripts run
	sudo ./install_linux_dependencies.sh
in same directory,
	sudo cp 40-open-ephys.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
	sudo service udev restart

on U14, you maybe don't have a correct version of g++
install g++-5:
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
	sudo apt-get install g++-5


go to "Build" directory:
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-5 ..


then you can run "make" in Build (or "make -B" to be sure to recompile everything or "make -j5" to paralellize on 5 cpu)
the binary is in Build/Release, enjoy !


((If you can't see the two plugins related to INTAN, you need to change the Build/Release/shared/libokFrontPanel.so.
A working version is available in ~/Dropbox/Kteam/intanMobsSource/proFileExample/libokFrontPanel.so)) (it happens)

To use the OnlineDecoding library, 
	git checkout onlineDecoding
You need a library to compile and use this : 
tensorflow compiled for C++ (see tensorflowC++Install.txt)

after that got to Build and rerun the cmake and make command !
